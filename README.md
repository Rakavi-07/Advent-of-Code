# Advent-of-Code
Advent of Code is a yearly competitive programming challenge consisting of 25 algorithmic puzzles released daily in December. Each problem requires analytical thinking, efficient algorithms, and clean implementation to solve real-world inspired computational tasks.

The problems focus on real-world inspired logic, requiring strong skills in problem analysis, algorithms, and efficient coding.
